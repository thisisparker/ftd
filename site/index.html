          <a href="posts/grace-lee-boggs">Grace Lee Boggs</a>
        </h2><p>Grace Lee Boggs was a human rights advocate whose work spanned the course of seven decades before her death in 2015. In the 1940s she co-founded the Johnson–Forest Tendency, a radical left group associated with Marxist humanism, and in the 1950s she married the Black radical activist James Boggs, and subsequently developed a professional relationship with Malcolm X. Her extensive FBI files cover two investigations: one from 1948-1974, and a separate one from 1953-1975.</p>
