FOIA The Dead is a long-term transparency project that uses the [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Information_Act_(United_States)) to request information from the FBI about the recently deceased.

That law requires certain government agencies to produce records upon a request from the public. One significant exception to that requirement is that, to protect the privacy of individuals, federal agencies may not release information about living people. But after their death, their privacy concerns are diminished, and those records can become available.

FOIA The Dead was founded to address that transition. When somebody's obituary appears in the _New York Times_, FOIA The Dead sends an automated request to the FBI for their (newly-available) records. In many cases, the FBI responds that it has no files on the individual. But in some cases it does, and can now release those files upon request. When FOIA The Dead receives it, the file gets published for the world to see.

FOIA The Dead uses MuckRock to submit and track its requests with the FBI. Browse through [MuckRock's FOIA resources](https://www.muckrock.com) or [read about its API](https://www.muckrock.com/api/).
